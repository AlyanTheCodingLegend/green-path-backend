# 🌳 GreenPath: The Shade & Walkability Navigator

A Python application that finds thermally comfortable walking routes in hot climates by prioritizing shade, greenery, and thermal comfort over shortest distance.

## Features

- **Thermal Comfort Scoring**: Analyzes vegetation (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), terrain slope, and building shadows
- **Dual Route Comparison**: Compare "Cool Route" vs "Fast Route" side-by-side
- **Interactive Map**: Click to select start/end points with comfort heatmap overlay
- **GPX Export**: Download routes for use in GPS devices or other apps
- **Data Caching**: Efficient caching to minimize API calls

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download

```bash
cd greenpath
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Google Earth Engine Authentication

GreenPath uses Google Earth Engine for satellite data. You need to authenticate:

1. **Sign up for GEE**: Go to [https://earthengine.google.com/](https://earthengine.google.com/) and sign up
2. **Authenticate**:
   ```bash
   earthengine authenticate
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to complete browser-based authentication

If you're using a service account:
1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Download the JSON key file
3. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/key.json"
   ```
4. Update `GEE_PROJECT` in `config.py` with your project ID

## Usage

### Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the Interface

1. **Select Location Method**: Choose between clicking on map, entering coordinates, or searching addresses
2. **Set Start & End Points**: Mark your origin and destination
3. **Click "Find Routes"**: Calculate both cool and fast routes
4. **Compare Results**: View distance, time, comfort scores, and tree coverage
5. **Export**: Download routes as GPX files

### Command-Line Testing

Test individual modules:

```bash
# Test data collection
python data_collection.py

# Test preprocessing
python preprocessing.py

# Test scoring
python scoring.py

# Test routing
python routing.py
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

- **City coordinates**: Change `CITY_CENTER_LAT`, `CITY_CENTER_LON` for different cities
- **Bounding box**: Adjust `BBOX_BUFFER` for study area size
- **Scoring weights**: Modify `WEIGHTS` to prioritize different comfort factors
- **H3 resolution**: Change `H3_RESOLUTION` (8-10 recommended)
- **Date range**: Update `DATE_START`, `DATE_END` for different seasons

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Resolution | Purpose |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Vegetation (NDVI) | Sentinel-2 | 10m | Tree/grass coverage |
| Surface Temperature (LST) | Landsat 8/9 | 30m | Heat mapping |
| Elevation/Slope | SRTM | 30m | Terrain difficulty |
| Road Network | OpenStreetMap | - | Walkable paths |
| Buildings | OpenStreetMap | - | Shadow estimation |

## How Comfort Score Works (Simple Explanation)

We look at **4 things** to decide how comfortable a spot is to walk:

### 1. Trees & Grass (NDVI) - 30% of score
- Satellite photos show how green an area is
- More green = more shade = cooler = **better score**
- Parks and tree-lined streets score high

### 2. Ground Temperature (LST) - 40% of score (biggest factor!)
- Satellites measure how hot the ground is
- Concrete and asphalt get very hot in summer
- Cooler ground = **better score**

### 3. How Flat (Slope) - 20% of score
- Flat ground = easier to walk = **better score**
- Steep hills make you sweat more in heat

### 4. Building Shadows - 10% of score
- Tall buildings cast shadows on streets
- More shadow = cooler walking = **better score**

### Score Categories
- **0.0 - 0.3** = Poor (hot, no trees, steep)
- **0.3 - 0.5** = Fair
- **0.5 - 0.7** = Good
- **0.7 - 1.0** = Excellent (shady, cool, flat, green)

## Technical Scoring Formula

### Weighted Method (Default)
```
Score = 0.30 × NDVI_norm + 0.40 × LST_inv + 0.20 × Slope_inv + 0.10 × Shadow_norm
```

Where:
- `NDVI_norm`: Normalized vegetation index (0-1, higher = more vegetation)
- `LST_inv`: Inverted land surface temperature (0-1, higher = cooler)
- `Slope_inv`: Inverted slope (0-1, higher = flatter)
- `Shadow_norm`: Building shadow potential (0-1, higher = more shade)

### Random Forest Method (Alternative)
GreenPath also supports a machine learning approach using **Random Forest Regression**:
- Generates synthetic UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) labels based on the input features
- Trains a RandomForestRegressor with 100 trees to predict comfort scores
- Useful for capturing non-linear relationships between environmental factors
- Can be enabled by changing the scoring method in `scoring.py`

## Sample City Data

Real satellite data collected from Google Earth Engine for Pakistani cities:

| City | Hexagons | NDVI Range | LST Range | Buildings | Mean Comfort | Distribution |
|------|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Rawalpindi | 254 | 0.045-0.382 | 43-54°C | 12 | 0.524 | 62% Good |
| Islamabad | 252 | 0.021-0.745 | 38-48°C | 1,098 | 0.469 | 34% Good |
| Lahore | 266 | 0.014-0.707 | 41-51°C | 1,263 | 0.415 | 65% Fair |
| Karachi | 309 | -0.034-0.499 | 16-48°C | 13,395 | 0.387 | 39% Fair |

**Key Observations:**
- Islamabad has the highest vegetation (NDVI up to 0.745) and coolest temperatures
- Karachi has the most buildings (13,395) but lowest comfort due to less greenery
- Rawalpindi has the highest percentage of "Good" comfort ratings (62%)

## Routing Algorithm

Two routes are calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm:

1. **Fast Route**: Minimizes distance (standard shortest path)
2. **Cool Route**: Minimizes combined cost:
   ```
   Cost = 0.3 × Distance + 0.7 × Discomfort × Distance
   ```

## Fallback Mode

If Google Earth Engine is unavailable (quota limits, authentication issues), GreenPath automatically generates synthetic data for demonstration purposes. This allows you to explore the interface and routing algorithms without GEE access.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GEE initialization failed"**
   - Run `earthengine authenticate` again
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify GEE account is active

2. **"Could not find routes"**
   - Points may be outside the road network
   - Try points closer to streets
   - Check if bounding box includes both points

3. **Slow first load**
   - Initial data collection takes 2-5 minutes
   - Subsequent runs use cached data
   - Reduce `BBOX_BUFFER` for faster processing

4. **Memory errors**
   - Reduce H3 resolution (use 8 instead of 9)
   - Process smaller area
   - Increase available RAM

### Clear Cache

To force fresh data download:
- Click "Clear Cache & Reload" in sidebar, or
- Delete the `cache/` folder manually

## Extending the Project

### Add New City

1. Update coordinates in `config.py`:
   ```python
   CITY_NAME = "Your City"
   CITY_CENTER_LAT = your_latitude
   CITY_CENTER_LON = your_longitude
   ```
2. Clear cache and restart

### Custom Scoring Weights

Adjust in `config.py`:
```python
WEIGHTS = {
    'ndvi': 0.40,    # Increase vegetation importance
    'lst': 0.30,     # Reduce temperature importance
    'slope': 0.20,
    'shadow': 0.10
}
```

### Add New Data Layers

1. Add fetching function in `data_collection.py`
2. Add processing in `preprocessing.py`
3. Include in scoring formula in `scoring.py`
